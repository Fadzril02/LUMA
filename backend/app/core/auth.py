"""
Smart Academic Assessment System — JWT Auth Dependency

Verifies Supabase session tokens signed with the project's asymmetric
ES256 JWT Signing Keys (JWKS-based, NOT the legacy HS256 shared secret).

This project (`gexcsnwztzajoupgjhpc`) has been confirmed to use the newer
asymmetric signing model. The JWKS endpoint is the only correct verification
target for user session tokens.

JWKS endpoint:
    https://gexcsnwztzajoupgjhpc.supabase.co/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json

The dependency `verify_advisor_jwt` is applied to every mutating endpoint
in audit.py (finalize-approval, extract, process-storage, purge-document).
It both verifies the token's ES256 signature AND cross-references the JWT's
identity (email) against the advisor_id claimed in the request body.
